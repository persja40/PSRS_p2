# UPC\+\+ Installation #

The general recipe for building and installing UPC\+\+ is to run the `install`
script found in the top-level (upcxx) source directory:

```bash
cd <upcxx-source-path>
./install <upcxx-install-path>
```

This will build the UPC\+\+ library and install it to the `<upcxx-install-path>`
directory. Users are recommended to use paths to non-existent or empty
directories as the installation path so that uninstallation is as trivial as
`rm -rf <upcxx-install-path>`.  Note that the install process downloads the
GASNet communication library, so an Internet connection is needed. Depending on
the platform, additional configuration may be necessary before invoking
`install`. See below.

**Installation: Linux**

The installation command above will work as is. The default compilers used will
be gcc/g++. The `CC` and `CXX` environment variables can be set to alternatives
to override this behavior. Additional environment variables allowing finer
control over how UPC\+\+ is configured can be found in the
"Advanced Installer Configuration" section below.

**Installation: Mac**

The Xcode Command Line Tools need to be installed *before* invoking `install`,
i.e.:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Installation: Cray XC**

To run on the compute nodes of a Cray XC, the `CROSS` environment variable needs
to be set before the install command is invoked,
i.e. `CROSS=cray-aries-slurm`. Additionally, because UPC\+\+ does not currently
support the Intel compilers (usually the default for these systems), either GCC
or Clang must be loaded, e.g.:

```bash
module switch PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu
cd <upcxx-source-path>
CROSS=cray-aries-slurm ./install <upcxx-install-path>
```

The installer will use the `cc` and `CC` compiler aliases of the Cray
programming environment loaded.

## Advanced Installer Configuration ##

The installer script tries to pick a sensible default behavior for the platform
it is running on, but the install can be customized using the following
environment variables:

* `CC`, `CXX`: The C and C\+\+ compilers to use.
* `CROSS`: The cross-configure settings script to pull from the GASNet source
  tree (computed as `<gasnet>/other/contrib/cross-configure-${CROSS}`).
* `GASNET`: Provides the GASNet-EX source tree from which the UPC\+\+ install
  script will build its own version of GASNet. This can be a path to a tarball,
  url to a tarball, or path to a full source tree.  Defaults to a url to a
  publicly available GASNet-EX tarball.
* `GASNET_CONFIGURE_ARGS`: List of additional command line arguments passed to
  GASNet's configure phase.
* `UPCXX_LPC_INBOX=[lockfree|locked|syncfree]`. The implementation to use for
  the internal `lpc` queues of personas.
    * `lockfree`: (default) Highest performance: one atomic instruction per
       enqueue.
    * `locked`: Simple mutex-based linked list. Lower performance, but also
       lower risk with respect to potential bugs in implementation.
    * `syncfree`: Thread unsafe queues. Will not function correctly in a
      multi-threaded context.

# Compiling Against UPC\+\+ #

With UPC\+\+ installed, the application's build process can query for the
appropriate compiler flags to enable building against upcxx by invoking the
`<upcxx-install-path>/bin/upcxx-meta <what>` script, where `<what>` indicates
which form of flags are desired. Valid values are:

* `PPFLAGS`: Preprocessor flags which will put the upcxx headers in the
  compiler's search path and define macros required by those headers.
* `LDFLAGS`: Linker flags usually belonging at the front of the link command
  line (before the list of object files).
* `LIBFLAGS`: Linker flags belonging at the end of the link command line. These
  will make libupcxx and its dependencies available to the linker.

For example, to build an application consisting of `my-app1.cpp` and
`my-app2.cpp`:

```bash
upcxx="<upcxx-install-path>/bin/upcxx-meta"
<c++ compiler> -std=c++11 $($upcxx PPFLAGS) -c my-app1.cpp
<c++ compiler> -std=c++11 $($upcxx PPFLAGS) -c my-app2.cpp
<c++ compiler> $($upcxx LDFLAGS) my-app1.o my-app2.o $($upcxx LIBFLAGS)
```

The `<c++ compiler>` used to build the application must be the same as the one
used for the UPC\+\+ installation.

For an example of a Makefile which builds UPC++ applications, look at
[example/prog-guide/Makefile](example/prog-guide/Makefile). This directory also
has code for running all the examples given in the programmer's guide. To use
that `Makefile`, first set the `UPCXX_INSTALL` shell variable to the
`<upcxx-install-path>`.

## UPC\+\+ Backends ##

UPC\+\+ provides multiple "backends" offering the user flexibility to choose the
means by which the parallel communication facilities are implemented. Those
backends are characterized by three dimensions: conduit, thread-mode, and
code-mode. The conduit and thread-mode parameters map directly to the GASNet
concepts of the same name (for more explanation, see below). Code-mode selects
between highly optimized code and highly debuggable code. The `upcxx-meta`
script will assume sensible defaults for these parameters based on the
installation configuration. The following environment variables can be set to
influence which backend `upcxx-meta` selects:

* `UPCXX_GASNET_CONDUIT=[smp|udp|aries|ibv]`: The GASNet conduit to use (the
  default value is platform dependent):
    * `smp` is the typical high-performance choice for single-node multi-core
      runs .
    * `udp` is a useful low-performance alternative for testing and debugging. 
    * `aries` is the high-performance Cray XC network.
    * `ibv` is the high-performance InfiniBand network.

* `UPCXX_THREADMODE=[seq|par]`: The value `seq` limits the application to only
  calling "communicating" upcxx routines from the thread that invoked
  `upcxx::init`, and only while that thread is holding the master persona. The
  benefit is that `seq` can be synchronization free in much of its internals. A
  thread-mode value of `par` allows any thread in the process to issue
  communication as allowed by the specification, allowing for greater injection
  concurrency from a multi-threaded application but at the expensive of greater
  internal synchronization (higher overheads per operation).  The default value
  is always `seq`.
  
* `UPCXX_CODEMODE=[O3|debug]`: `O3` is for highly compiler-optimized
  code. `debug` produces unoptimized code, includes extra error checking
  assertions, and is annotated with the symbol tables needed by debuggers. The
  default value is always `O3`.

# Running UPC\+\+ Programs #

To run a parallel UPC\+\+ application, use the `upcxx-run` launcher provided in
the installation.

```bash
<upcxx-install-path>/bin/upcxx-run -n <ranks> <exe> <args...>
```

This will run the executable and arguments `<exe> <args...>` in a parallel
context with `<ranks>` number of UPC\+\+ ranks.

Upon startup, each UPC\+\+ rank creates a fixed-size shared memory heap that will never grow. By
default, this heap is 128 MB per rank. This can be adjust by passing a `-shared-heap` parameter
to the run script, which takes a suffix of KB, MB or GB; e.g. to reserve 1GB per rank, call:

```bash
<upcxx-install-path>/bin/upcxx-run -shared-heap 1G -n <ranks> <exe> <args...>
```

There are several additional options that can be passed to `upcxx-run`. Execute with `-h` to get a
list of options.
